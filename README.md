# Light-Following-Robot
This project is a simple mobile robot designed to follow a light source using two 4-pin Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) modules. The robot is controlled by a microcontroller (such as an Arduino) and can move towards a light source like an LED or flashlight.

## **Features**
- **Basic Movement**: The robot can move forward, left, and right.
- **Light Detection**: Two 4-pin LDR modules to detect light intensity and guide the robot.
- **Modular Design**: Easily expandable with additional sensors and functionalities.

## **Components**

- **Chassis**: Base frame for the robot.
- **Motors**: DC motors for movement.
- **Motor Driver**: L298N motor driver.
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino.
- **Power Supply**: Batteries suitable for the motors and microcontroller.
- **Wheels**: For movement.
- **LDR Modules**: Two 4-pin LDR modules for light detection.
- **Miscellaneous**: Wires, breadboard, resistors, etc.
